           <h1>Impact on Creative Expression and Critical Thinking</h1>
           <p>The ability to share ideas via the Internet is providing users an unrivaled vehicle for creative expression. No longer dependent<br> upon publishers, mass media, and other traditional distribution channels, thousands of writers, poets, scientists, musicians, students,<br> and others are making their work available to others around the globe. The existing latent creative talent surfacing in the exchanges of<br> the Internet confirms that as individuals we have not yet become nearly as passive or simple-minded as critics of our society, and our<br> education system, would lead us to believe. On the contrary, given this vehicle for being heard, individuals of all ages are engaging in<br> complex, educational, and highly creative interchanges.</p>
  <p>In order to prepare themselves for these interchanges, students at all skill levels are demonstrating an increased interest in<br> reading and writing. Students who believe their work will be read by a truly interested audience excel in writing above their individual<br> past performance levels; they learn quickly that in order to be understood, they must express themselves clearly and rise to the<br> challenge. Similarly, students receiving information they have requested or specifically searched for often read above their past skill<br> level with great determination; these students care about the information before them and find purpose and reward in working hard to<br> comprehend even difficult materials.</p>
  <p>
Teachers and students exploring the Internet together are developing skills for questioning, researching, analyzing, discussing,<br> hypothesizing, and proposing. These capabilities are gradually replacing the traditionally valued skills of objectification and<br> memorization. As students and teachers together learn to become more creative, the Internet provides them a mechanism through<br> which they can share their enthusiasm and discoveries with others. In this scenario, the networked classroom becomes a place where<br> information is viewed as a starting point, critical thinking is essential, and creative application of information is the key to learning.</p>
